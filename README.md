Grow your machine learning skills with scikit-learn and discover how to use this popular Python library to train models using labeled data. In this course, you'll learn how to make powerful predictions, such as whether a customer is will churn from your business, whether an individual has diabetes, and even how to tell classify the genre of a song. Using real-world datasets, you'll find out how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen data.
